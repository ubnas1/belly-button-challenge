# belly-button-challenge

In this Project, I have created a dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

I used D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

A dropdown menu is created to select the IDs present in the dataset.

I created the Bar Chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual ID.

A bubble chart is also included that displays each sample for selected individual ID.

Another cool thing I have done is that I have included an info card named as Demographic info, which shoes the Demographic info of the selected individual.
